## Achievement

Designed plastic memory capsules with embedded SNN plasticity engines, dual dirty/clean states, hash-chained deltas, and optional neuromod sync from Astromind for colony-wide chemical balance

## Rationale

Traditional storage is either mutable (no audit trail) or immutable (can't evolve). Thermograms combine both with SNN-driven plasticity that generates auditable deltas. Multiple Thermograms can coexist as independent organisms or sync neuromodulation for colony coordination. This enables scalable hot knowledge stores that mirror brain architecture: local plasticity with global chemical modulation
